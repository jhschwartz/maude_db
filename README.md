## What is maude_db?

`maude_db` provides a simple interface to work with the FDA's MAUDE database locally. It handles downloading data files from FDA servers, importing them into a SQLite database, and provides convenient query methods for analysis. The library is designed specifically for researchers who need reproducible, offline access to medical device adverse event data.

For background on the MAUDE database, see [docs/maude_overview.md](docs/maude_overview.md).

## Key Features

- **Automated Downloads**: Fetch MAUDE data files directly from FDA servers with built-in caching
- **Flexible Querying**: Simple methods for common queries plus full SQL access for complex analysis
- **Trend Analysis**: Built-in functions for analyzing adverse events over time
- **Narrative Access**: Retrieve event narrative descriptions for qualitative analysis
- **Export Support**: Export query results to CSV for further analysis
- **Research-Focused**: Designed for reproducibility and offline analysis

## Quick Start

```python
from maude_db import MaudeDatabase

# Create database and download data
db = MaudeDatabase('maude.db')
db.add_years(2020, tables=['device'], download=True)

# Query for specific devices
results = db.query_device(device_name='pacemaker')
print(f"Found {len(results)} pacemaker events in 2020")

# Analyze trends
trends = db.get_trends_by_year(device_name='pacemaker')
print(trends)

db.close()
```

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Internet connection (for downloading FDA data)
- Sufficient disk space (varies by years downloaded; ~100MB per year for device data)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone or download this repository
cd maude_db

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For installing from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/maude_db.git
```

## Documentation

- **[Getting Started Guide](docs/getting_started.md)** - Step-by-step tutorial for first-time users
- **[MAUDE Overview](docs/maude_overview.md)** - Understanding the FDA MAUDE database structure
- **[API Reference](docs/api_reference.md)** - Complete documentation of all methods
- **[Research Guide](docs/research_guide.md)** - Best practices for medical device research
- **[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)** - Solutions to common problems

## Examples

The [`examples/`](examples/) directory contains working examples:

- **[basic_usage.py](examples/basic_usage.py)** - Minimal example showing core functionality (1998 data, ~3MB download)
- **[analyze_device_trends.py](examples/analyze_device_trends.py)** - Comprehensive example with trend analysis and visualization (2018-2020 data)

Run an example:

```bash
cd examples
python basic_usage.py
```

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for more details and customization options.

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify your installation:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run only unit tests (fast, no downloads)
pytest -m "not integration"

# Run integration tests (downloads real FDA data)
pytest -m integration
```

All tests should pass. Integration tests require an internet connection and will download small amounts of real FDA data.

## Use Cases

This library is designed for:

- **Device Safety Surveillance**: Monitor adverse events for specific device types over time
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns in device malfunctions, injuries, or deaths
- **Regulatory Research**: Analyze FDA reporting data for academic or policy studies
- **Comparative Studies**: Compare safety profiles across different devices or manufacturers
- **Signal Detection**: Screen for potential safety signals in medical devices
