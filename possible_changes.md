# Possible Changes & Future Enhancements


- **Confirm utility of different tables** 
  - What do they each have? are the master and patient tables even necessary? would be nice to not use them. it's possible they each contain minimal data already present elsewhere for convinience.


- **noticed in notebooks**
  - seems like cacheing is not working for master table and it may be reloading years unnecessarily -- specifically, if one year is added, then all years existing get deleted and reinitialized
  - notebooks 1-6 ok, failure in nb 7
  - notebooks will likely be redone with upcoming claude updates upon usage refresh


--> should integration tests spot check actual data from fda?? 

--> in the widget, might need a way to investigate further the events which when you get to the end, they are still under a generic manufacturer that you can't accept or reject.


## Future Enhancements

- **Deduplication logic** - Prevent duplicate records when re-adding years
- **Incremental updates** - Support for monthly FDA update files (`*add.zip`, `*change.zip`)
- **Parallel table processing** - Download/process multiple tables simultaneously
- **Progress bars** - Better visual feedback for long-running operations
- **Query builder** - Higher-level API for complex queries without SQL
- **Data validation** - Verify row counts and data integrity after import
