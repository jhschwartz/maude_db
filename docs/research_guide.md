## Planning Your Analysis

### Define Your Research Question

Start with a clear, specific question:

**Good examples**:
- "How have thrombectomy device adverse events changed from 2015-2020?"
- "What are the most common failure modes for drug-eluting stents?"
- "How does event reporting differ between manufacturer vs. user facility reports?"

**Too vague**:
- "Are pacemakers safe?" (needs denominator data, causation)
- "What devices have problems?" (too broad)

### Determine Your Time Range

Consider:
- **Reporting changes**: FDA requirements have evolved
- **Device evolution**: Newer models may have different profiles
- **Sample size**: More years = more events but slower downloads
- **Recent data**: Latest year may be incomplete

**Quick start**: 3-5 recent years gives good trends without overwhelming data.

```python
# Good starting point for trend analysis
db.add_years('2018-2022', tables=['device'], download=True)
```

### Choose Your Device Scope

Options for identifying devices:

1. **Generic name**: Broad category (`'catheter'`, `'pacemaker'`)
2. **Product code**: Specific device type (`'NIQ'`)
3. **Brand name**: Specific manufacturer product (`'Trevo'`)

**Tip**: Start broad, then narrow:

```python
# Step 1: See what's available
all_catheters = db.query_device(device_name='catheter')
print(all_catheters['GENERIC_NAME'].value_counts())

# Step 2: Pick specific type
specific = db.query_device(device_name='intravascular catheter')
```

## Which Data to Download

### Essential Tables

**For most research**:
```python
db.add_years('2018-2020', tables=['device'], download=True)
```

- **device**: Device information (brand, generic name, manufacturer)
- Good for: Counting events, trends, device comparisons

**Add for richer analysis**:
```python
db.add_years('2018-2020', tables=['device', 'text'], download=True)
```

- **text**: Narrative descriptions of events
- Good for: Qualitative analysis, understanding failure modes

**Add for patient demographics**:
```python
db.add_years('2018-2020', tables=['device', 'patient'], download=True)
```

- **patient**: Age, outcomes, event dates
- Good for: Patient outcome analysis

### Disk Space Considerations

Approximate sizes per year:

| Tables | Size/Year | 5 Years Total |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| device only | ~45 MB | ~225 MB |
| device + text | ~90 MB | ~450 MB |
| device + text + patient | ~100 MB | ~500 MB |

**Tip**: Start with device table, add others if needed.

### Master Table Note

The master table (MDRFOI) is only available as a comprehensive file covering all years:
- Very large (~1+ GB)
- Not downloaded automatically by `maude_db`
- Device table contains most key fields via joins

For most research, device + text tables are sufficient.

## Common Analysis Patterns

### Pattern 1: Count Events Over Time

```python
# Simple trend
trends = db.get_trends_by_year(device_name='pacemaker')
print(trends)

# Visualize
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(trends['year'], trends['event_count'])
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Events Reported')
plt.title('Pacemaker Adverse Events')
plt.show()
```

### Pattern 2: Compare Device Types

```python
# Get events for multiple device types
catheters = db.query_device(device_name='catheter')
stents = db.query_device(device_name='stent')

print(f"Catheter events: {len(catheters)}")
print(f"Stent events: {len(stents)}")
```

### Pattern 3: Identify Top Generic Names

```python
devices = db.query_device(start_date='2020-01-01', end_date='2020-12-31')

# Count by generic name
top_devices = devices['GENERIC_NAME'].value_counts().head(10)
print(top_devices)
```

### Pattern 4: Analyze Event Types

```python
results = db.query_device(device_name='defibrillator')

# Count event types
print(results['EVENT_TYPE'].value_counts())

# Filter to serious events using FDA abbreviations (D=Death, IN=Injury)
serious = results[results['EVENT_TYPE'].str.contains(r'\bD\b|\bIN\b', case=False, na=False, regex=True)]
print(f"Serious events: {len(serious)}/{len(results)}")
```

### Pattern 5: Examine Narratives

```python
# Get events
events = db.query_device(device_name='thrombectomy', start_date='2020-01-01')

# Sample some events
sample_keys = events['MDR_REPORT_KEY'].sample(10).tolist()

# Get narratives
narratives = db.get_narratives(sample_keys)

# Look for patterns
for idx, row in narratives.iterrows():
    text = row['FOI_TEXT'].lower()
    if 'fracture' in text or 'break' in text:
        print(f"Report {row['MDR_REPORT_KEY']}: {row['FOI_TEXT'][:150]}")
```

### Pattern 6: Filter by Manufacturer

```python
results = db.query_device(device_name='stent')

# Count by manufacturer
mfr_counts = results['manufacturer_d_name'].value_counts()
print(mfr_counts.head())

# Filter to specific manufacturer
medtronic = results[results['manufacturer_d_name'].str.contains('Medtronic', na=False, case=False)]
```

---

## Data Quality Tips

### Check for Completeness

```python
# How many events have narratives?
devices = db.query_device(device_name='catheter')
keys = devices['MDR_REPORT_KEY'].tolist()
narratives = db.get_narratives(keys)

print(f"Events: {len(devices)}")
print(f"With narratives: {len(narratives)}")
print(f"Coverage: {len(narratives)/len(devices)*100:.1f}%")
```

### Handle Missing Data

```python
results = db.query_device(device_name='pacemaker')

# Check for missing brand names
missing_brand = results['BRAND_NAME'].isna().sum()
print(f"Missing brand names: {missing_brand}/{len(results)}")

# Filter to complete records
complete = results.dropna(subset=['BRAND_NAME', 'GENERIC_NAME'])
```

### Understand Reporting Bias

Be aware that:
- **Voluntary reporting** is inconsistent
- **High-profile events** increase reporting temporarily
- **New devices** may have higher reporting (heightened awareness)
- **Old devices** may be underreported (less attention)

**Tip**: Use year-over-year trends to identify real patterns vs. reporting artifacts.

### Verify Unexpected Results

If you see surprising patterns:

```python
# Sudden spike in events?
trends = db.get_trends_by_year(device_name='insulin pump')
# Look at year-to-year changes

# Unusual event count?
devices = db.query_device(device_name='unusual_device')
# Check sample narratives to verify it's actually your target device
```

---

## Working with Large Datasets

### Efficient Querying

**Do**: Filter early
```python
# Good - filter in query
recent_pacers = db.query_device(
    device_name='pacemaker',
    start_date='2020-01-01'
)
```

**Don't**: Load everything then filter
```python
# Inefficient
all_devices = db.query("SELECT * FROM device")  # Loads millions of rows
pacers = all_devices[all_devices['GENERIC_NAME'].str.contains('pacemaker')]
```

### Chunked Processing

For very large result sets:

```python
# Process in chunks
query = """
    SELECT MDR_REPORT_KEY, GENERIC_NAME
    FROM device
    WHERE GENERIC_NAME LIKE '%catheter%'
"""

for chunk in pd.read_sql_query(query, db.conn, chunksize=10000):
    # Process each chunk
    print(f"Processing {len(chunk)} records...")
    # Your analysis here
```

### Memory Management

```python
# Free memory after large operations
import gc

large_result = db.query_device(device_name='catheter')
# ... use large_result ...
del large_result
gc.collect()
```

## Common Research Workflows

### Workflow 1: Device Safety Surveillance

**Goal**: Monitor adverse events for a specific device type

```python
db = MaudeDatabase('surveillance.db')

# Download recent years
db.add_years('2020-2023', tables=['device', 'text'], download=True)

# Query device
events = db.query_device(device_name='insulin pump')

# Analyze trends
trends = db.get_trends_by_year(device_name='insulin pump')

# Identify serious events using FDA abbreviations (D=Death, IN=Injury)
serious = events[events['EVENT_TYPE'].str.contains(r'\bD\b|\bIN\b', case=False, na=False, regex=True)]

# Examine narratives of serious events
serious_keys = serious['MDR_REPORT_KEY'].head(20).tolist()
narratives = db.get_narratives(serious_keys)

# Export for detailed review
serious.to_csv('serious_events.csv', index=False)
```

### Workflow 2: Comparative Device Study

**Goal**: Compare safety profiles of two device types

```python
db = MaudeDatabase('comparison.db')
db.add_years('2018-2022', tables=['device'], download=True)

# Get events for each device
device_a = db.query_device(product_code='ABC')
device_b = db.query_device(product_code='XYZ')

# Compare event types
print("Device A event types:")
print(device_a['event_type'].value_counts())

print("\nDevice B event types:")
print(device_b['event_type'].value_counts())

# Trend comparison
trends_a = db.get_trends_by_year(product_code='ABC')
trends_b = db.get_trends_by_year(product_code='XYZ')

# Visualize
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(trends_a['year'], trends_a['event_count'], label='Device A')
plt.plot(trends_b['year'], trends_b['event_count'], label='Device B')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Workflow 3: Failure Mode Analysis

**Goal**: Identify common device failure patterns

```python
db = MaudeDatabase('failure_modes.db')
db.add_years('2020-2022', tables=['device', 'text'], download=True)

# Get device events
events = db.query_device(device_name='cardiac catheter')

# Get all narratives
keys = events['MDR_REPORT_KEY'].tolist()
narratives = db.get_narratives(keys)

# Search narratives for failure keywords
keywords = ['fracture', 'break', 'disconnect', 'leak', 'malfunction']

for keyword in keywords:
    count = narratives['FOI_TEXT'].str.contains(keyword, case=False, na=False).sum()
    print(f"{keyword}: {count} mentions")

# Extract examples
fractures = narratives[narratives['FOI_TEXT'].str.contains('fracture', case=False, na=False)]
print(f"\n{len(fractures)} fracture-related events")
```

### Workflow 4: Temporal Analysis

**Goal**: Identify when event reporting changed

```python
db = MaudeDatabase('temporal.db')
db.add_years('2015-2023', tables=['device'], download=True)

# Get long-term trends
trends = db.get_trends_by_year(device_name='pacemaker')

# Calculate year-over-year changes
trends['yoy_change'] = trends['event_count'].pct_change() * 100

print("Year-over-year change in reporting:")
print(trends[['year', 'event_count', 'yoy_change']])

# Identify notable changes
notable = trends[abs(trends['yoy_change']) > 20]
print(f"\nYears with >20% change: {notable['year'].tolist()}")
```

### Workflow 5: SQLite-Only Research

**Goal**: Conduct research using only SQLite tools (no Python coding)

This workflow is ideal for researchers comfortable with SQL but not Python, or those who want to export data for analysis in Excel, R, or other tools.

#### Step 1: Initialize Database

```bash
cd /path/to/maude_db
./init_full_db.sh
```

Follow prompts:
- Year range: `2018-2024`
- Tables: `1,2` (device and text)
- Filename: `my_research.db`

#### Step 2: Open in SQLite Tool

- Download [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) (free, cross-platform)
- Open `my_research.db`

#### Step 3: Explore Data

```sql
-- Check what's in the database
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM device;

-- Find your device type
SELECT DISTINCT GENERIC_NAME
FROM device
WHERE GENERIC_NAME LIKE '%your_device%'
ORDER BY GENERIC_NAME;
```

#### Step 4: Run Analysis Queries

See [04_advanced_querying.ipynb](../notebooks/04_advanced_querying.ipynb) for ready-to-use queries:

```sql
-- Count events by year
SELECT
    strftime('%Y', DATE_RECEIVED) as year,
    COUNT(*) as report_count
FROM device
WHERE GENERIC_NAME LIKE '%pacemaker%'
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;

-- Get reports with narratives
SELECT
    d.GENERIC_NAME,
    d.BRAND_NAME,
    d.MANUFACTURER_D_NAME,
    t.FOI_TEXT
FROM device d
JOIN text t ON d.MDR_REPORT_KEY = t.MDR_REPORT_KEY
WHERE d.GENERIC_NAME LIKE '%your_device%'
LIMIT 100;
```

#### Step 5: Export Results

**In DB Browser for SQLite:**
1. Run your query
2. Click "Export to CSV" button
3. Save the results

**In DBeaver:**
1. Run your query
2. Right-click results → "Export Data"
3. Choose CSV, Excel, or other format

#### Step 6: Analyze Exported Data

- Open CSV in Excel for charts and pivot tables
- Import into R or Python for statistical analysis
- Use Tableau, PowerBI for visualization
- Share with collaborators

#### Example Research Workflow

**Research Question**: "How have pacemaker adverse events changed over time?"

1. **Initialize database** with years 2015-2024, device and text tables
2. **Query device counts** by year (SQL query)
3. **Export to CSV**
4. **Create chart in Excel** showing trends
5. **Sample narratives** for qualitative analysis (SQL query with RANDOM())
6. **Export narratives to CSV** for thematic coding
7. **Combine quantitative and qualitative findings**

#### Benefits of SQLite-Only Workflow

- **No coding required**: Just SQL queries
- **Visual interface**: Browse data in tables
- **Easy export**: CSV works everywhere
- **Shareable**: Send database file to collaborators
- **Flexible**: Can always add Python later if needed

#### Tips for SQLite Workflows

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: First count total, then filter
2. **Use LIMIT**: Preview before exporting large results
3. **Save queries**: Keep a text file of useful queries
4. **Check the guide**: See [sqlite_guide.md](sqlite_guide.md) for detailed instructions
5. **Export early**: Get data into your preferred analysis tool

#### When to Consider Python

Switch to Python API when you need:
- Complex data transformations
- Automated workflows
- Statistical analysis in Python
- Integration with pandas, scikit-learn, etc.

The database works with both approaches - use what fits your skills and needs!

## Understanding Limitations

### What MAUDE Can Tell You

- **Adverse events occurred**: Reports document what happened
- **Patterns exist**: Trends and common issues
- **Signals for investigation**: Potential safety concerns

### What MAUDE Cannot Tell You

- **Causation**: Reports don't prove device caused event
- **Incidence rates**: No denominator (devices in use)
- **Comparison across devices**: Different usage rates, reporting patterns
- **Complete picture**: Voluntary reporting means many events unreported

### Using MAUDE Responsibly

**Do**:
- Use for signal detection and hypothesis generation
- Combine with other data sources (literature, registries)
- Consider reporting biases in interpretation
- Note limitations in publications

**Don't**:
- Claim causation from MAUDE data alone
- Compare raw counts across dissimilar devices
- Assume absence of reports means device is safe
- Use single reports as definitive evidence

### Example Methods Section

For publications using MAUDE data:

> We analyzed FDA MAUDE adverse event reports for [device type] from [years].
> MAUDE contains voluntary and mandatory reports of device-related deaths,
> injuries, and malfunctions. Reports are unverified allegations and do not
> establish causation. We used MAUDE data for signal detection and hypothesis
> generation, recognizing inherent reporting biases and the lack of denominator
> data on total devices in use. Analysis was performed using the maude_db
> Python library (version X.X, Schwartz 2025).
